/**
 * \mainpage Doxygen support for OpenHIP
 *
 * The software is split across a number of different CVS modules:
 *     - <code>hip:</code>  User-space protocol engine for HIP
 *     - <code>hipd:</code>  Legacy (pre-0.4 release) branch of current 
 *     <code>hip</code> module (obsolete)
 *     - <code>patches:</code> bind (DNS), Ethereal/Wireshark, ipsec-tools, 
 *     and Linux kernel patches for HIP
 *     
 *
 * The <a href=http://www.openhip.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page>OpenHIP
 * wiki</a> is presently the source of most of our project documentation.  This
 * Doxygen directory contains source code cross reference of the raw
 * (not doxygen-commented) APIs and data structures in the hip module only.
