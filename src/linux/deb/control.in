Description: OpenHIP for running the Host Identity Protocol in Linux user space. .
 OpenHIP is a free, open-source implementation of the Host Identity Protocol (HIP). HIP is being developed within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) to study and experiment with HIP and related protocols.
 .
 HIP is a specific proposal to decouple network identity from network location in the Internet protocol stack. Historically, IP addresses have served both functions. This dual use of IP addresses is becoming problematic, and there have been many research efforts aimed at studying the decoupling of identifier and locator in the network stack. HIP is a specific proposal that uses public/private key pairs as the host identifiers.
